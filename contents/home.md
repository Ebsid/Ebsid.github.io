Ebsid Research Group, affiliated with the School of AI, BIT, focuses on scientific and technological research on issues such as decision-making and planning in swarm confrontation, event-based (visual, task, target, etc.) swarm behavior capability generation, and uncertainty quantification and ad-hoc decision-making. It comprehensively utilizes cutting-edge technologies including multimodal large models, deep reinforcement learning, synchronization and phase transition, and spatial topological planning, aiming to solve the challenges of how artificial intelligence makes correct decisions and resolves decision conflicts in swarm behavior, and to empower the collaboration of unmanned aerial vehicle/unmanned ground vehicle (UAV/UGV) swarms.

群智决策课题组隶属于北京理工大学人工智能学院，面向群体对抗中的决策与规划、基于事件（视觉、任务、目标等）的群体行为能力生成、不确定性量化与临机决策等问题进行科学与技术攻关，主要涉及多模态大模型、深度强化学习、同步与相变、空间拓扑规划等技术领域，解决人工智能在群体行为中如何正确决策与如何解决决策冲突的难题，同时赋能无人机/无人车集群协作能力生成。
